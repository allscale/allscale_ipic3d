# ipic3d

This project is the AllScale implementation of the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method; 
the original pilot is called iPIC3D. This pilot is used for the simulation of space 
and fusion plasmas during the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth magnetic 
field. These physical processes may effect people and technology in space and on the Earth. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have GCC 5 installed and set as your default C/C++ compiler.
Furthermore CMake 3.5 (or later) is required for the build and testing process.

### Configuration

Following options can be supplied to CMake

| Option              | Values          |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  | Release / Debug |
| -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS | ON / OFF        |
| -DBUILD_TESTS       | ON / OFF        |
| -DBUILD_DOCS        | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_ASSERT        | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_VALGRIND      | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_ALLSCALECC    | ON / OFF        |
| -DTHIRD_PARTY_DIR   | \<path\>        |

The file `cmake/build_settings.cmake` states their default value.

### Building / Testing

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../code
    $ make -j8
    $ ctest -j8

## Using the AllScale Compiler

To use the AllScale compiler, you first have to setup the required dependencies
in order to build it. A dependency installer is provided, running the following
commands should be sufficient on most systems. See
`scripts/dependencies/README.md` for more details.

    $ scripts/dependencies/installer
    $ scripts/dependencies/third_party_linker

To build this project using the AllScale compiler, simply set the corresponding
CMake option. You may want to use a separate build directory to easily switch
between GCC and AllScaleCC.

    $ mkdir build_with_allscalecc
    $ cd build_with_allscalecc
    $ cmake -DUSE_ALLSCALECC=ON ..
    $ make -j8
    $ ctest -j8

## Development

### Executable Bit

When working on Windows via SMB share, consider setting following Git setting.

    $ git config core.filemode false

### Licensor

A script, together with a Git hook, is provided to automatically add a license
header to each source file upon commit. See `scripts/license`.

### Eclipse Project

    $ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" /path/to/project

### Visual Studio Solution

    $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF Z:\path\to\project

Add path for third-party libraries when needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting GCC 5 / CMake 3.5 / Valgrind (for Testing)

The dependency installer can setup these required tools for you. Its README
(`scripts/dependencies/README.md`) holds the details.

It is preferred to use the operating system's package manager, if applicable.

### No Source Folder in Eclipse Project

Make sure your build folder is located outside the source folder. Eclipse is
not capable of dealing with such a setup correctly.
