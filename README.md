# ipic3d

This project is the AllScale implementation of the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method; 
the original pilot is called iPIC3D. This pilot is used for the simulation of space 
and fusion plasmas during the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth magnetic 
field. These physical processes may effect people and technology in space and on the Earth. 

## Quickstart

Ensure you have GCC 5 installed and set as your default C/C++ compiler.
Furthermore CMake 3.5 (or later) is required for the build and testing process.
Simply execute the following commands to build the project and run all tests.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../code
    $ make -j8
    $ ctest -j8

## Advanced Options

### Configuration

Following options can be supplied to CMake

| Option              | Values          |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  | Release / Debug |
| -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS | ON / OFF        |
| -DBUILD_TESTS       | ON / OFF        |
| -DBUILD_DOCS        | ON / OFF        |
| -DBUILD_COVERAGE    | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_ASSERT        | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_VALGRIND      | ON / OFF        |
| -DUSE_ALLSCALECC    | ON / OFF        |
| -DENABLE_PROFILING  | ON / OFF        |
| -DTHIRD_PARTY_DIR   | \<path\>        |

The files `cmake/build_settings.cmake` and `code/CMakeLists.txt` state their
default value.

## Using the AllScale Compiler

To use the AllScale compiler, you first have to setup the required dependencies
in order to build it. A dependency installer is provided, running the following
commands should be sufficient on most systems. See
`scripts/dependencies/README.md` for more details.

    $ scripts/dependencies/installer
    $ scripts/dependencies/third_party_linker

To build this project using the AllScale compiler, simply set the corresponding
CMake option. You may want to use a separate build directory to easily switch
between GCC and AllScaleCC.

    $ mkdir build_with_allscalecc
    $ cd build_with_allscalecc
    $ cmake -DUSE_ALLSCALECC=ON ..
    $ make -j8
    $ ctest -j8

## Development

### Adding new Modules

The setup script can be run again to add new modules, just provide the same
project name.

    $ scripts/setup/run ipic3d frontend backend utils

### Adding new Parts to Modules

There is a utility script to add new *parts* to an existing module. The project
name and module name must be provided followed by a list of *parts* to
generate. Folders will be created along the way.

    $ scripts/setup/add_part ipic3d frontend sema extensions/malloc_extension

This will add the files `sema.h`, `sema.cpp` and `sema_test.cc` to the
*frontend* module. Furthermore new subfolders `extensions` will be created
containing `malloc_extension.h`, `malloc_extension.cpp` and
`malloc_extension_test.cc` in their respective subdirectories.

### Executable Bit

When working on Windows via SMB share, consider setting following Git setting.

    $ git config core.filemode false

### Licensor

A script, together with a Git hook, is provided to automatically add a license
header to each source file upon commit. See `scripts/license`.

### Eclipse Project

    $ cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" /path/to/project

### Visual Studio Solution

    $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF Z:\path\to\project

Add path for third-party libraries when needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting GCC 5 / CMake 3.5 / Valgrind (for Testing)

The dependency installer can setup these required tools for you. Its README
(`scripts/dependencies/README.md`) holds the details.

It is preferred to use the operating system's package manager, if applicable.

### No Source Folder in Eclipse Project

Make sure your build folder is located outside the source folder. Eclipse is
not capable of dealing with such a setup correctly.

### Coverage

Building the coverage us currently only supported on Linux, as Perl and Bash
are required. To build and view the coverage set the corresponding CMake flag
to `ON` and run:

    $ make
    $ make coverage
    $ xdg-open coverage/index.html
